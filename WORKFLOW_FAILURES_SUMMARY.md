## ‚ùå **FAILING WORKFLOWS (6)**

### 1. **Security Scan** ‚ùå
**Issue**: Security audit failing
```
Run security audit
##[error]Process completed with exit code 1
```
**Cause**: Likely vulnerability in dependencies or security policy violation

### 2. **Quality Gates** ‚ùå
**Issue**: Quality check failing
**Cause**: Not clear from logs - may be related to Quality Gates workflow depending on Security Scan

### 3. **Comprehensive Testing** ‚ùå
**Issue**: Missing environment variables causing validation failures
```
‚ùå Environment validation failed:
  ‚Ä¢ SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY: Invalid input: expected string, received undefined
  ‚Ä¢ STRIPE_SECRET_KEY: Invalid input: expected string, received undefined
  ‚Ä¢ STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET: Invalid input: expected string, received undefined
  ‚Ä¢ VERIS_SIGNING_PRIVATE_KEY: Invalid input: expected string, received undefined
  ‚Ä¢ VERIS_SIGNING_PUBLIC_KEY: Invalid input: expected string, received undefined
```
**Cause**: Environment variables not set in workflow for E2E, Performance, and Contract test jobs

### 4. **Deploy to Production** ‚ùå
**Issue**: Deployment failing
**Cause**: Depends on Quality Gates, which is failing

### 5. **Registry Snapshot and Arweave Publishing** ‚ùå
**Issue**: AWS credentials not configured
```
##[error]Credentials could not be loaded, please check your action inputs: 
Could not load credentials from any providers
```
**Cause**: Missing AWS credentials in GitHub secrets

### 6. **Monitoring and Alerting** ‚ùå
**Issue**: Health checks returning 404
**Cause**: API endpoints not deployed (expected - these are monitoring for future deployment)

## üîß **REQUIRED FIXES**

### Fix 1: Add Missing Environment Variables to Comprehensive Testing
**File**: `.github/workflows/test-comprehensive.yml`

Add environment variables to:
- E2E Tests job
- Performance Tests job  
- Contract Tests job

Example:
```yaml
env:
  NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL: https://test.supabase.co
  NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY: test-key
  SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY: test-service-key
  STRIPE_SECRET_KEY: sk_test_placeholder
  STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET: whsec_placeholder
  VERIS_SIGNING_PRIVATE_KEY: -----BEGIN PRIVATE KEY-----\ntest-private-key\n-----END PRIVATE KEY-----
  VERIS_SIGNING_PUBLIC_KEY: -----BEGIN PUBLIC KEY-----\ntest-public-key\n-----END PUBLIC KEY-----
```

### Fix 2: Fix Security Scan
**Action**: Run `pnpm audit` locally to identify vulnerabilities and fix them

### Fix 3: Add AWS Credentials for Registry Workflow
**Action**: Add AWS credentials to GitHub secrets repository settings

### Fix 4: Monitoring Workflow (Low Priority)
**Status**: Expected to fail until API is deployed
**Action**: Already added 404 handling - workflow will pass once API is live

---

## üìä **Success Rate**
- **Passing**: 9/15 (60%)
- **Failing**: 6/15 (40%)

---

## üéØ **Next Steps**
1. Fix environment variables in Comprehensive Testing workflow
2. Investigate and fix security vulnerabilities
3. Add AWS credentials for Registry workflow
4. Verify Quality Gates workflow dependencies
