## Key Rotation Procedures

### Cryptographic Key Rotation

Veris uses RSA keys for signing and verifying proofs. Key rotation is critical for security and must be performed without service interruption.

#### Prerequisites

- Access to production environment variables
- Backup of current keys
- Monitoring dashboard access
- Communication plan for stakeholders

#### Rotation Process

1. **Preparation Phase**

   ```bash
   # Generate new key pair
   openssl genrsa -out new_private.pem 2048
   openssl rsa -in new_private.pem -pubout -out new_public.pem

   # Verify key format
   openssl rsa -in new_private.pem -text -noout
   ```

2. **Dual-Key Window Setup**

   - Deploy new keys alongside existing keys
   - Update environment variables with both old and new keys
   - Verify both keys are loaded and functional
   - Monitor for any issues during dual-key period

3. **Cutover Process**

   - Update primary key references to use new keys
   - Keep old keys available for verification of existing proofs
   - Monitor system performance and error rates
   - Document rotation completion

4. **Cleanup Phase**
   - Remove old keys from environment (after verification period)
   - Update documentation
   - Archive old keys securely
   - Notify stakeholders of completion

#### Key Rotation Checklist

- [ ] New key pair generated and validated
- [ ] Keys stored securely (encrypted at rest)
- [ ] Dual-key configuration deployed
- [ ] All services restarted with new configuration
- [ ] Verification tests pass with both keys
- [ ] Monitoring shows no errors
- [ ] Old keys removed from active configuration
- [ ] Documentation updated
- [ ] Incident response team notified

### Database Credentials Rotation

1. **Generate new service key** in Supabase dashboard
2. **Update environment variables** in all environments
3. **Deploy changes** with zero-downtime deployment
4. **Verify functionality** across all services
5. **Revoke old key** after verification period

#### Stripe Webhook Secret Rotation

1. **Generate new webhook secret** in Stripe dashboard
2. **Update environment variables**

3. **Resolution Phase** (1-4 hours)

   - Implement permanent fix
   - Verify resolution
   - Monitor system stability
   - Document incident details

4. **Post-Incident** (24-48 hours)
   - Conduct post-mortem review
   - Update runbooks and procedures
   - Implement preventive measures
   - Share lessons learned
