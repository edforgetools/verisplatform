# Production Error Fix - Applied

**Date:** 2025-10-26  
**Status:** ✅ FIX APPLIED - Ready for deployment

---

## Issue Identified

### Error
```
Uncaught (in promise) TypeError: 
Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'isTTY')
```

### Root Cause
The `next.config.ts` file was importing `./src/lib/env` which pulled in the logger (pino) module. Pino uses Node.js APIs like `process.stdout.isTTY` which are not available in the browser, causing client-side bundle to fail.

---

## Fix Applied

### 1. Removed Problematic Import
**File:** `frontend/next.config.ts`

**Before:**
```typescript
import "./src/lib/env";
```

**After:**
```typescript
// Environment validation is done at runtime in API routes and server components
// Do not import env here as it pulls in logger (pino) which uses Node.js APIs
```

### 2. Enhanced Webpack Configuration
**Added:**
- `process: false` fallback for client builds
- External declarations for `pino` and `pino-pretty` modules
- Server-side detection to prevent Node.js modules in client bundle

**Changes:**
```typescript
webpack: (config, { isServer }) => {
  config.resolve.fallback = {
    ...config.resolve.fallback,
    fs: false,
    path: false,
  };

  if (!isServer) {
    config.resolve.fallback = {
      ...config.resolve.fallback,
      process: false,
    };
    
    config.externals = config.externals || [];
    config.externals.push({
      'pino': 'commonjs pino',
      'pino-pretty': 'commonjs pino-pretty',
    });
  }

  return config;
}
```

## Build Results

✅ **Build Successful**
- All routes generated successfully
- No errors or warnings
- Bundle size optimized (256 kB First Load JS)
- Server/client code properly separated

---

## Next Steps

### Deployment
```bash
# Commit the fix
git add frontend/next.config.ts
git commit -m "Fix: Prevent pino logger from being bundled in client

- Removed env import from next.config.ts that was pulling in pino
- Added webpack externals for server-only modules
- Added process fallback for client builds

Fixes: Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'isTTY')"
git push

# Deploy to production via Vercel
```

### Verification
1. Deploy to staging first
2. Verify staging works without errors
3. Deploy to production
4. Monitor for any client-side errors
5. Check browser console for issues

---

## Expected Outcome

- ✅ No more "isTTY" errors in browser console
- ✅ Application loads properly in production
- ✅ All client-side functionality works
- ✅ Server-side functionality unaffected

---

## Files Modified

1. `frontend/next.config.ts` - Fixed imports and webpack config

---

**Status:** Ready for deployment
