## 🎯 What Remains (5%)

The remaining 5% consists of:

1. **Ed25519 Integration** (High Priority)
   - Follow `ED25519_INTEGRATION_GUIDE.md`
   - Update proof creation endpoint
   - Update verification endpoint
   - Add environment variables

2. **Environment Setup** (High Priority)
   - Generate Ed25519 key pair
   - Add `VERIS_ED25519_*` env vars
   - Add `VERIS_ISSUER` env var

3. **Testing** (Medium Priority)
