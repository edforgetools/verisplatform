- ✅ Confirmed auto-cancel working for workflows
- ✅ web_quality workflow: PASSING
- ⏳ e2e workflow: RUNNING (should complete soon)

### 4. Codebase Analysis

- ✅ Verified disabled Ed25519 files are NOT used (registry-snapshot, arweave-publisher)
- ✅ Confirmed S3 registry is implemented (s3-registry.ts)
- ✅ Confirmed Arweave publisher is NOT implemented (disabled file)
- ✅ Confirmed C2PA adapter NOT implemented (out of scope per mvp.md §2.6)

## 📊 MVP.md Compliance Status

### ✅ In-scope MVP Features (mvp.md §1)

- Canonical proof format: ✅ Complete
- Website Trust Layer: ✅ Complete
  - `/` - Home: ✅ Complete
  - `/demo` - Demo: ✅ Complete (with JSON preview)
  - `/verify` - Verify: ✅ Complete (with paste proof.json)
  - `/billing` - Billing: ✅ Complete
- Paid issuance: ✅ Complete
- Free verification: ✅ Complete (public API)
- Public demo: ✅ Complete

### ⏳ Partially Implemented

- **Persistence Mirrors (mvp.md §2.4)**:
  - ✅ S3 multi-region: Implemented
  - ❌ Arweave: NOT implemented (file disabled)
- **C2PA adapter (mvp.md §2.6)**: NOT implemented (no adapter found)

### ❌ Out of Scope for MVP

- C2PA adapter (explicitly "out-of-scope" until further notice)
- Arweave publisher (disabled, not used)

## 🔄 Current Status

- **web_quality**: ✅ PASSING
- **e2e**: ⏳ Running (~5 minutes) - should complete soon
- **Security alerts**:
  - ✅ Hardcoded key removed from workflow files
  - ⚠️ Alert #2 still open (key in old commit history) - will auto-resolve when GitHub rescans
- **Frontend**: All improvements complete and ready for deployment
- **Keys Rotated**: ✅ VERIS_SIGNING_PRIVATE_KEY and VERIS_SIGNING_PUBLIC_KEY

## 📝 Recommendations

### Immediate (After E2E Completes)

1. **Verify workflows pass** - should be done in ~3-5 minutes
2. **Check GitHub security alerts** - GitHub will rescan and may auto-close alert #2
3. **Monitor deployment** - should auto-deploy if configured

### Future (Nice to Have)

1. **Git history cleanup** - Use BFG repo cleaner to remove exposed keys from history
2. **Arweave implementation** - Add persistence mirror per mvp.md §2.4 (currently disabled)
3. **C2PA adapter** - Out of scope for MVP, can implement later if needed

## 🚀 Next Steps

Once e2e passes:

- All workflows will be green
- Security alert should resolve
- Frontend improvements will deploy to verisplatform.com
- Users will see: JSON preview, paste proof.json, cleaner homepage

## 📦 Files Changed

- 10 files modified (frontend improvements)
- 2 workflow files fixed (security)
- 1 test file fixed (e2e mocks)
- 2 new files created (sitemap.xml, robots.txt)
- 1 file deleted (CONTEXT_FOR_NEW_AGENT.md → now this doc)
